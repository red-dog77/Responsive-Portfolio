# Responsive-Portfolio
Responsive *HTML* portfolio page with bootstrap framework.
This is a project to showcase some of the skills gained over the time of doing the coding bootcamp.
The finished product should be a responsive and easy to read package which will navigate through three pages with various information about myself and some of the web applications I have constructed.
